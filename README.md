### Current Projects

- [HMCCosmetics](https://github.com/HibiscusMC/HMCCosmetics)  
  - A *Minecraft* Cosmetic Plugin that seeks to add cosmetics to the Java Edition of the game safely for server operators. For sale on [Polymart](https://polymart.org/resource/hmccosmetics.1879). Proudly Open Source. 
- [Hibiscus Commons](https://github.com/HibiscusMC/HibiscusCommons)
  - A *Minecraft* Plugin that handles boilerplate between the many Hibiscus plugins that rely on the same underlying systems. Mostly for internal use, however, is offered with HMC plugins to help them run. 
- [HMCConverter](https://github.com/HibiscusMC/HMCCConverter)
  - An online converter that utilizes the platform Discord to convert files from one format to another. A perk of purchasing the plugin but still being open source.
- [DvZRemapped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg2fX4iUxJE)
  - An online game mode for *Minecraft* that matches 20+ people as "Dwarfs" where they face off for as long as possible against monsters. As players die, they become monsters too. Commonly hosted on the HibiscusMC server.   
- Java Developer @ [Hibiscus Creative Studios](https://github.com/HibiscusMC)
  - Build and maintain private plugins, such as HMCCooking, HMCQuests, and HMCHuskHomes, that better the player experience with new features, all the while squashing bugs to ensure the best experience. 
- Java Developer @ [Cow Creations](https://store.wildwoodsmp.com/)
  - Upgrade and enhance applications that work at scale on a constantly evolving network that deals with a large load of players seeking a new experience different from many other servers. 

### Previous Projects

- HMCDataLake
  - A plugin that sought to collect information about players to store in the database for further analysis. Was abandoned from lack of time and needed a complete rewrite to keep up with the read/write of the database on large loads. Learned a lot about SQL databases from this project. 
- [Health-Transit Final](https://github.com/LoJoSho/Health-Transit-Walkability-Final)
  - A one-off final project for my data class that sought to understand how health, walkability, and transit access related to each other.
- [Uber-Data](https://github.com/LoJoSho/Uber-Data)
  - A one off R Shinny project for Data 332 that correlated where riders are at. Made a prediction engine to predict where the next rider will be based on the time of day.
 - [Data332](https://github.com/LoJoSho/Data332)
   - Collection of notes, projects, and misc tasks that I worked on during my time in Data 332.
